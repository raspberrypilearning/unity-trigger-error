Make sure any characters/objects that you want to collide with have a **Box Collider** with `Is Trigger` selected.

If your characters/objects also have a **Character Controller** for collision detection, you need to make sure that the **Box Collider** that triggers your script is larger than the Character Collider so that you can get close enough to trigger it.
